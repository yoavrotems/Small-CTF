# CTF
Hello all :) this is a small ctf I wrote in the subjects of Linux, containers and binaries.

A bit about me, 
I am Yoav Rotem I work in [aqua security](https://www.aquasec.com/) as an open source developer 
Those challenges here are not hard and just to have fun and test your experience with Linux 
Feel free to open issues and contribute
